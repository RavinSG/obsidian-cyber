802.1X is an *IEEE standard for network access control* ([[Network Access Control|NAC]]), and it is used for authentication for *devices that want to connect to a network*. In 802.1X systems, supplicants send authentication requests to authenticators such as network switches, access points, or wireless controllers.

Those controllers connect to an authentication server, typically via [[Remote Authentication Dial-in User Service|RADIUS]]. The RADIUS servers may then rely on a backend directory using [[LDAP]] or [[Active Directory]] as a source of identity information.
