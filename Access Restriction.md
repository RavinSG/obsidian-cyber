Access restrictions are security measures that limit the ability of individuals or systems to access sensitive information. Two common types of access restrictions are geographic restrictions and permission restrictions.

- Geographic restrictions limit access to resources based on the physical location of the user or the system. 

- Permission restrictions limit access to resources based on user's role or level of authorisation.
