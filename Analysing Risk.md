In an enterprise risk management ([[Enterprise Risk Management|ERM]]) program, organisations take a *formal approach to risk analysis* that begins with **identifying risks**, continues with **determining the severity of each risk**, and then results in **adopting one or more risk management strategies** to address each risk.

Before we move too deeply into the risk assessment process, let's define a few important terms that we'll use during our discussion:

- [[Threats]] are any possible events that might have an adverse impact on the confidentiality, integrity, and/or availability of our information or information systems.
  
- [[Vulnerabilities]] are weaknesses in our systems or controls that could be exploited by a threat.
  
- [[Risks]] occur at the intersection of a vulnerability and a threat that might exploit that vulnerability. A threat without a corresponding vulnerability does not pose a risk, nor does a vulnerability without a corresponding threat.
