It’s necessary to create an audit checklist before conducting an [[Security Audit|audit]]. A checklist is generally made up of the following areas of focus:

#### Identify the scope of the audit
The audit should:
- List assets that will be assessed (e.g., firewalls are configured correctly, PII is secure, physical assets are locked, etc.) 
- Note how the audit will help the organization achieve its desired goals
- Indicate how often an audit should be performed
- Include an evaluation of organisational policies, protocols, and procedures to make sure they are working as intended and being implemented by employees

#### Completing a risk assessment
- A risk assessment is used to evaluate identified organisational risks related to budget, controls, internal processes, and external standards (i.e., regulations).

#### Conduct the audit
- When conducting an internal audit, you will assess the security of the identified assets listed in the audit scope.

#### Create a mitigation plan
- A mitigation plan is a strategy established to lower the level of risk and potential costs, penalties, or other issues that can negatively affect the organisation’s security posture. 

#### Communicate results to stakeholders
- The end result of this process is providing a detailed report of findings, suggested improvements needed to lower the organisation's level of risk, and compliance regulations and standards the organisation needs to adhere to.
