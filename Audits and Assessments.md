The corner stone maintenance activity for an information security team is their security assessment and testing program. This program includes tests, assessments, and audits that regularly *verify that an organisation has adequate security controls*.

There are three major components of a security assessment program:

- [[Security Tests]]
- [[Security Assessments]]
- [[Security Audits]]
