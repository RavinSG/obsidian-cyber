Using a password remains the most common means of authentication, but passwords have a number of flaws. The first, and most important, is that passwords can be stolen and used by third parties with relative ease. Unless the owner of the password changes it, the password will remain usable by attackers. 

Passwords are also susceptible to brute-force attacks, allowing a determined attacker who can spend enough time freely using them to eventually break into a system. This has led to the use of multiple factors, preventing a lost or stolen password from allowing easy account compromise.
