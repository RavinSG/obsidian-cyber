 Security orchestration, automation, and response ([[Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response|SOAR]]) platforms provide many opportunities to automate security tasks that cross between multiple systems. Two key characteristics of processes that can be automated are that they are both *repeatable and do not require human interaction*. 

Cybersecurity professionals also use scripting to achieve their automation goals. Scripting can be instrumental in automation repetitive tasks and streamlining security operations.

### Use cases of Automation and Scripting

- **User provisioning**: Automated scripts can handle the process of adding, modifying, pr removing user access to systems and networks, reducing manual efforts and human error.

- **Resource provisioning**: Scripts can automate allocation and the deallocation of system resources ensuring optimal performance.
  
- **Guard rails**: Automations can be employed to enforce policy controls and prevent violations of security protocols.
  
- **Security groups**: Automated processes can manage security group memberships ensuring users have appropriate permissions.
  
- **Ticket creation**: Automation can streamline the ticketing process, enabling immediate creation and routing of issues to the right teams.
  
- **Escalation**: In case of a major incident, scripts can automate the escalation process, alerting key personnel quickly

- **Enabling/disabling services**: Automation can be used to turn services or access on or off based on certain triggers or conditions

- **Continuous integration and testing**: Scripts can automate the build and test processes, ensuring faster and more reliable software delivery.
  
- **Integration and APIs**: Automated processes can handle data exchange between different software applications through APIs, enhancing interoperability.


### Benefits of Automation and Scripting

- **Achieving efficiency and time saving**: Automation reduces manual tasks, allowing team members to focus on higher-level tasks
  
- **Enforcing baselines**: Automation ensures consistent application of security baselines across systems and networks.
  
- **Standardising infrastructure configurations**: Scripts can automate the process of configuring systems, ensuring uniformity and reducing errors
  
- **Scaling in a secure manner**: Automation supports rapid scaling of infrastructure while maintaining security controls
  
- **Retaining employees**: Automation of mundane tasks can increase job satisfaction and employee retention
  
- **Reducing reaction time**: Automated alerts and response can significantly reduce the time to react to security incidents
  
- **Serving as a workforce multiplier**: Automation increases the capacity of the team by handling repetitive tasks efficiently acting as a force multiplier.


### Other complexities

While the benefits of automation and scripting are significant, it's also essential to be aware of potential challenges or considerations that might arise during the implementation process.

- **Complexity**: While automation can simplify many processes, the development and management of automation scripts can be complex and require a high level of technical skill
  
- **Cost**: Implementing automation and scripting often involves upfront costs, including investment in tools, training, and potentially new staff members with specific experience
  
- **Single point of failure**: Over-reliance on automation might lead to a single point of failure where one malfunctioning script or process could impact a significant part of the operation
  
- **Technical debt**: Over time, as systems evolve and change automated scripts might become outdated or inefficient, creating a form of "technical debt" that needs to be addressed
  
- **Ongoing supportability**: Maintaining and updating scripts to ensure they remain effective and compatible with the systems is a continual task that requires dedication.
