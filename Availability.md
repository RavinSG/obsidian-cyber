**Availability** is the idea that data is accessible to those who are authorized to use it. When a system adheres to both availability and confidentiality principles, data can be used when needed.

In the workplace, this could mean that the organisation allows remote employees to access its internal network to perform their jobs. It’s worth noting that access to data on the internal network is still limited, depending on what type of access employees need to do their jobs. If, for example, an employee works in the organisation’s accounting department, they might need access to corporate accounts but not data related to ongoing development projects. 

Availability controls, such as fault tolerance, clustering, and backups, seek to ensure that legitimate users may gain access as needed.
