In cybersecurity, backdoors are *weaknesses intentionally left by programmers or system and network administrators* that bypass normal access control mechanisms. Backdoors are intended to help programmers conduct troubleshooting or administrative tasks. However, backdoors can also be installed by attackers after theyâ€™ve compromised an organization to ensure they have persistent access.

Once the hacker has entered an insecure network through a backdoor, they can cause extensive damage: *installing malware, performing a denial of service (DoS) attack, stealing private information or changing other security settings* that leaves the system vulnerable to other attacks. A DoS attack is an attack that targets a network or server and floods it with network traffic.
