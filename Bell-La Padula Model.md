The Bell-La Padula Model is used to achieve [[Confidentiality]]. This model has a few assumptions, such as an organisation's hierarchical structure it is used in, where everyone's responsibilities/roles are well-defined.

The model works by *granting access to pieces of data (called objects) on a strictly need to know basis*. This model uses the rule "**no write down, no read up**".


| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| :--: | :--: |
| Policies in this model can be replicated to real-life organisations hierarchies (and vice versa) | Even though a user may not have access to an object, they will know about its existence, so it's not confidential in that aspect. |
| Simple to implement and understand, and has been proven to be successful. | The model relies on a large amount of trust within the organisation. |
