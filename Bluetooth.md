Bluetooth operates in the 2.4 GHz range, which is used for many different wireless protocols. Bluetooth is primarily used for *low-power, short-range* (less than 100 meters and typically 5â€“30 meters) connections that *do not have very high bandwidth needs*. 

Bluetooth devices are usually **connected in a point-to-point** rather than a client-server model. A typical Bluetooth connection is done by pairing, a process that searches for devices that are looking to connect.

Bluetooth has four security modes:

- Security Mode 1: No security (non-secure)
- Security Mode 2: Service-level enforced security
- Security Mode 3: Link-level enforced security
- Security Mode 4: Standard pairing with Security Simple Pairing (SSP)
