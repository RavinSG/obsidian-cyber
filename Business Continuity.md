Security teams must be prepared to minimise the impact that security incidents can have on their normal business operations. When an incident occurs, *organisations might experience significant disruptions to the functionality* of their systems and services. Prolonged disruption to systems and services can have serious effects, causing legal, financial, and reputational damages. Organisations can use business continuity planning so that they can *remain operational during any major disruptions*.

Similar to an incident response plan, a *business continuity plan* (BCP) is a document that **outlines the procedures to sustain business operations during and after a significant disruption**. A BCP helps organisations ensure that critical business functions can resume or can be quickly restored when an incident occurs.

[[Business Continuity Plan|Business continuity plans]] are *not the same as disaster recovery plans*. [[Disaster Recovery Plan|Disaster recovery plans]] are used to recover information systems in response to a major disaster. These disasters can range from hardware failure to the destruction of facilities from a natural disaster, like a flood. 

### Recovery strategies 

When an outage occurs due to a security incident, organisations must have some sort of a functional recovery plan set to resolve the issue and get systems fully operational. BCPs can include strategies for recovery that focus on returning to normal operations. Site resilience is one example of a recovery strategy. 

### Site resilience 

**Resilience** is the ability to prepare for, respond to, and recover from disruptions. Organisations can design their systems to be resilient so that they can continue delivering services despite facing disruptions. An example is site resilience, which is used to ensure the availability of networks, data centres, or other infrastructure when a disruption happens. There are three types of recovery sites used for site resilience:

- *Hot sites*: A fully operational facility that is a duplicate of an organisation's primary environment. Hot sites can be activated immediately when an organisation's primary site experiences failure or disruption.

- *Warm sites*: A facility that contains a fully updated and configured version of the hot site. Unlike hot sites, warm sites are not fully operational and available for immediate use but can quickly be made operational when a failure or disruption occurs.

- *Cold sites*: A backup facility equipped with some of the necessary infrastructure required to operate an organisation's site. When a disruption or failure occurs, cold sites might not be ready for immediate use and might need additional work to be operational.
