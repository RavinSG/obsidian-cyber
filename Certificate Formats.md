Digital certificates are stored in files, and those files come in a variety of different formats, both binary and text-based:

- The most common binary format is the Distinguished Encoding Rules (*DER*) format. DER certificates are normally stored in files with the .**DER**, .**CRT**, or .**CER** extensions.
  
- The Privacy Enhanced Mail (*PEM*) certificate format is an ASCII text version of the DER format. PEM certificates are normally stored in files with the .**PEM** or .**CRT** extensions
  
- The Personal Information Exchange (*PFX*) format is commonly used by Windows systems. PFX certificates may be stored in binary form, using either .**PFX** or .**P12** file extensions.
  
- Windows systems also use **P7B** certificates, which are stored in ASCII text format.
