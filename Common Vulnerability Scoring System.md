The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (**CVSS**) is an industry standard for assessing the severity of security vulnerabilities. It provides a technique for scoring each vulnerability on a variety of measures. Cybersecurity analysts often use CVSS ratings to prioritise response actions.

Analysts scoring a new vulnerability begin by rating the vulnerability on *eight different measures*. Each measure is given both a descriptive rating and a numeric score. 

The *first four measures evaluate the exploitability of the vulnerability*, whereas the *last three evaluate the impact of the vulnerability*. The eighth metric discusses the scope of the vulnerability.

### CVSS Metrics
#### Attack Vector Metric
The attack vector metric describes *how an attacker would exploit the vulnerability* and is assigned according to the criteria shown below.

| Value                | Description                                                                                  | Score |

| Physical (P)<br>     | The attacker must physically touch the vulnerable device.<br>                                | 0.20  |
| Local (L)            | The attacker must have physical or logical access to the affected system.                    | 0.55  |
| Adjacent Network (A) | The attacker must have access to the local network that the affected system is connected to. | 0.62  |
| Network<br>(N)<br>   | The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely over a network.                          | 0.85  |

### Interpreting the CVSS Vector

The CVSS vector uses a single-line format to convey the ratings of a vulnerability on all six of the metrics described in the preceding sections. For example, consider the following CVSS vector:  `CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N`

This vector contains nine components. The **first section**, “CVSS:3.0,” indicates that the vector was composed using *CVSS version 3*. The **next eight sections** correspond to each of the *eight CVSS metrics*.

- Attack Vector: Network (score: 0.85)
- Attack Complexity: Low (score: 0.77)
- Privileges Required: None (score: 0.85)
- User Interaction: None (score: 0.85)
- Scope: Unchanged
- Confidentiality: High (score: 0.56)
- Integrity: None (score: 0.00)
- Availability: None (score: 0.00)

### Summarising CVSS Scores

The CVSS vector provides good detailed information on the nature of the risk posed by a vulnerability, but the *complexity of the vector makes it difficult to use in prioritisation* exercises. For this reason, analysts can **calculate the CVSS base score**, which is a single number representing the overall risk posed by the vulnerability.

#### Calculating the Impact Sub-Score (ISS)
The first calculation analysts perform is computing the impact sub-score (ISS). This metric summarises the three impact metrics using the formula:

$$ISS = 1 - [(1-Confidentiality) \times (1 - Integrity) \times (1 - Availability)]$$

Plugging the values for the above vulnerability, we obtain

$$
\begin{align} ISS &= 1 - [(1-0.56) \times (1 - 0.00) \times (1 - 0.00)] \\ 
ISS &= 1 - [0.44 \times 1.00 \times 1.00 ] \\
ISS &= 1 - 0.44 \\
ISS &= 0.56
\end{align}
$$
#### Calculating the Impact Score
To obtain the impact score from the impact sub-score, we must take the value of the scope metric into account. If the **scope metric is Unchanged**, as it is in our example, we multiply the ISS by 6.42:

$$
\begin{align} Impact &= 6.42 \times ISS \\
Impact &= 6.42 \times 0.56 \\
Impact &= 3.60
\end{align}
$$

If the score metric is Changed, we use a more complex formula:

$$
Impact = 7.52 \times (ISS - 0.029) - 3.25 \times (ISS - 0.02)^2
$$

#### Calculating the Exploitability Score
Analysts may calculate the exploitability score for a vulnerability using this formula:

$$
Explotability = 8.22 \times \text{Attack Vector} \times \text{Attack Complexity} \times \text{Privileges Required} \times \text{User Interaction}
$$

Plugging in the values for the above vulnerability, we get.

$$\begin{align}
Exploitability &= 8.22 \times 0.85 \times 0.77 \times 0.85 \times 0.85 \\
Exploitability &= 3.89
\end{align}
$$

#### Calculating the Base Score
With all of this information at hand, we can now determine the CVSS base score using the following rules:

- If the impact is 0, the base score is 0.
- If the scope metric is **Unchanged**, calculate the base score by *adding together* the impact and exploitability scores.
- If the scope metric is **Changed**, calculate the base score by adding together the impact and exploitability scores and *multiplying the result by 1.08*.
- The highest possible base score is 10. If the calculated value is greater than 10, set the base score to 10.

For our above example, we get the value 7.5 by adding 3.6 and 3.9 together.

### Categorising CVSS Base Scores

Many vulnerability scanning systems further summarise CVSS results by *using risk categories* rather than numeric risk ratings. These are usually based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale, shown below.

| CVSS Score   | Rating   |
| ------------ | -------- |
| $0.0$        | None     |
| $0.1 - 3.9$  | Low      |
| $4.0 - 6.9$  | Medium   |
| $7 - 8.9$    | High     |
| $9.0 - 10.0$ | Critical |
