This domain focuses on *managing and securing* physical *networks* and wireless communications. This includes on-site, remote, and cloud communications. 

Organisations with remote, hybrid, and on-site work environments must ensure data remains secure, but managing external connections to make certain that remote workers are securely accessing an organisation’s networks is a challenge. Designing network security controls—such as restricted network access—can help protect users and ensure an organisation’s network remains secure when employees travel or work outside of the main office.
