Legislators and regulators around the world take an interest in cybersecurity due to the potential impact of cybersecurity shortcomings on individuals, government, and society. Whereas the European Union (EU) has a broad-ranging data protection regulation, cybersecurity analysts in the United States are forced to deal with a patchwork of security regulations covering different industries and information categories. 

### Common Compliance Requirements

Some of the major information security regulations facing organisations include the following:

- *The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act* (**HIPAA**) includes security and privacy rules that affect health-care providers, health insurers, and health information clearinghouses in the United States.

- *The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard* (**PCI DSS)** provides detailed rules about the storage, processing, and transmission of credit and debit card information. PCI DSS is not a law but rather a contractual obligation that applies to credit card merchants and service providers worldwide.

- *The Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act* (**GLBA**) covers U.S. financial institutions, broadly defined. It requires that those institutions have a formal security program and designate an individual as having overall responsibility for that program.
  
- *The Sarbanes–Oxley* (**SOX**) Act applies to the financial records of U.S. publicly traded companies and requires that those companies have a strong degree of assurance for the IT systems that store and process those records.
  
- *The General Data Protection Regulation* (**GDPR**) implements security and privacy requirements for the personal information of European Union residents worldwide.
  
- *The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act* (**FERPA**) requires that U.S. educational institutions implement security and privacy controls for student educational records.
  
- Various data breach notification laws describe the requirements that individual states place on organisations that suffer data breaches regarding notification of individuals affected by the breach.

### Compliance Reporting

Organisations need to engage in both *internal and external compliance reporting* to **ensure that they meet the regulatory requirements** and maintain transparency within the organisation and with external stakeholders. 

Internal compliance reporting is a vital component in maintaining an organisation's security posture and ensuring adherence to various laws and regulations. Internal reporting typically involves regular reports to the management or the board, highlighting the state of compliance, identifying gaps, and providing recommendations for improvement. These reports are essential for decision-makers within the organisation to understand the compliance landscape, allocate resources effectively, and ensure that compliance objectives align with the organisation's strategic goals.

External compliance reporting, on the other hand, is mandated by regulatory bodies or as a part of contractual obligations. It involves providing necessary documentation and evidence to external entities to demonstrate that the organisation is in compliance with relevant laws and regulations. For instance, organisations handling credit card data might need to submit compliance reports to the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (PCI SSC), and those under GDPR must be ready to provide compliance evidence to data protection authorities. External compliance reporting is crucial for maintaining good standing with regulatory authorities, avoiding penalties, and building trust with customers and partners by demonstrating a commitment to security and privacy.
