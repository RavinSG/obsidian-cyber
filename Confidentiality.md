**Confidentiality** is the idea that only authorised users can access specific assets or data. In an organization, confidentiality can be *enhanced* through the implementation of *design principles*, such as the *principle of least privilege*. 

The principle of least privilege limits users' access to only the information they need to complete work-related tasks. Limiting access is one way of maintaining the confidentiality and security of private data. 

This can be achieved through:
- Firewalls
- Access Control Lists
- Encryption
