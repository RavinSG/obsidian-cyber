## Goals of Cryptography
Security practitioners use cryptographic systems to meet *four fundamental goals*: **confidentiality**, **integrity**, **authentication**, and **nonrepudiation**. Achieving each of these goals requires the satisfaction of a number of design requirements, and not all crypto-systems are intended to achieve all four goals.
