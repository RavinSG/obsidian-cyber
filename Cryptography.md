## Goals of Cryptography
Security practitioners use cryptographic systems to meet *four fundamental goals*: **confidentiality**, **integrity**, **authentication**, and **nonrepudiation**. Achieving each of these goals requires the satisfaction of a number of design requirements, and not all crypto-systems are intended to achieve all four goals.

### Confidentiality

Confidentiality ensures that data remains private in three different situations: when it is *at rest*, when it is *in transit*, and when it is *in use*.

Confidentiality is perhaps the most *widely cited goal* of cryptosystemsâ€”the preservation of secrecy for stored information or for communications between individuals and groups. Two main types of cryptosystems enforce confidentiality.

- Symmetric cryptosystems
- Asymmetric cryptosystems

**Obfuscation** is a concept closely related to confidentiality. It is the practice of making it intentionally difficult for humans to understand how code works. This technique is often used to hide the inner workings of software, particularly when it contains sensitive intellectual property.
