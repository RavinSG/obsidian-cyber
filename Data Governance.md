**Data governance** is a set of processes that define *how an organization manages information*. Governance often includes policies that specify how to keep **data private, accurate, available, and secure** throughout its lifecycle.

Effective data governance is a collaborative activity that relies on people. Data governance policies commonly categorise individuals into a specific role:

- *Data owner*: the person that decides who can access, edit, use, or destroy their information
- *Data custodian*: anyone or anything that's responsible for the safe handling, transport, and storage of information
- *Data steward*: the person or group that maintains and implements data governance policies set by an organization

### Protecting data at every stage

Most security plans include *a specific policy that outlines how information will be managed* across an organization. This is known as a **data governance policy**. These documents clearly define procedures that should be followed to participate in keeping data safe. 

They place limits on who or what can access data. Security professionals are important participants in data governance. As a data custodian, you will be responsible for ensuring that data isnâ€™t damaged, stolen, or misused.
