**DevOps** *combines software development and IT operations* with the goal of optimising the SDLC. This is done by using collections of tools called toolchains to improve the coding, building and test, packaging, release, configuration and configuration management, and monitoring elements of a software development life cycle.

The term **DevSecOps** describes *security as part of the DevOps* model. In this model, security is a shared responsibility that is part of the entire development and operations cycle.

The role of security practitioners in a DevSecOps model includes *threat analysis and communications, planning, testing, providing feedback*, and of course *ongoing improvement and awareness responsibilities*.

DevOps and DevSecOps are often combined with **continuous integration and continuous deployment** ([[Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment|CI/CD]]) methodologies, where they can rely on *automated security testing, and integrated security tooling*, including scanning, updates, and configuration management tools, to help ensure security
