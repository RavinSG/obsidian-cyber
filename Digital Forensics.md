### Digital Forensic Concepts

A key element of digital forensics is the **acquisition and analysis of digital forensic data**. That data can be in the form of *drives*, *files*, *copies of live memory*, and any of the other multitude of *digital artefacts* that we create in the normal process of using computers and networks. Gathering that forensic data is just the start of a process that *involves careful documentation* and detailed analysis.

Throughout the process, the **creation of documentation** is necessary in order to be successful. You will document *timelines* and *sequences of events*, looking for clues as to what occurred and why, and use *time stamps, file metadata, event logs*, and a multitude of clues to piece together a complete picture.

The human side of digital forensics can also be important; **interviews with individuals** involved in the activity can provide important clues. That means you can't merely be a technical forensics expert in some casesâ€”instead, you have to leverage your knowledge of *both technology and human behaviours* to complete your forensic effort.
