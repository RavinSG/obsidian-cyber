Once you have chosen a cryptographically sound [[Hash Functions|hashing algorithm]], you can use it to implement a digital signature system. Digital signature infrastructures have two distinct goals:

- Digitally signed messages assure the recipient that the message truly came from the claimed sender. They enforce nonrepudiation.
  
- Digitally signed messages assure the recipient that the message was not altered while in transit between the sender and recipient. This protects against both malicious modification and unintentional modification.
