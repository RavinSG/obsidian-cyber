Once you have chosen a cryptographically sound [[Hash Functions|hashing algorithm]], you can use it to implement a digital signature system. Digital signature infrastructures have two distinct goals:

- Digitally signed messages assure the recipient that the message truly came from the claimed sender. They enforce nonrepudiation.
  
- Digitally signed messages assure the recipient that the message was not altered while in transit between the sender and recipient. This protects against both malicious modification and unintentional modification.

Digital signature algorithms rely on a combination of the two major concepts, **public key cryptography** and **hashing functions**.

If Alice wants to digitally sign a message she's sending to Bob, she performs the following actions:

1. Alice generates a message digest of the original plaintext message using one of the cryptographically sound hashing algorithms, such as SHA3-512.
2. Alice then encrypts only the message digest using her private key. This encrypted message digest is the digital signature.
3. Alice appends the signed message digest to the plaintext message.
4. Alice transmits the appended message to Bob.

When Bob receives the digitally signed message, he reverses the procedure, as follows:

1. Bob decrypts the digital signature using Alice's public key.
2. Bob uses the same hashing function to create a message digest of the full plaintext message received from Alice.
3. Bob then compares the decrypted message digest he received from Alice with the message digest he computed himself. If the two digests match, he can be assured that the message he received was sent by Alice. If they do not match, either the message was not sent by Alice or the message was modified while in transit.

### HMAC

The Hashed Message Authentication Code (HMAC) algorithm implements a partial digital signatureâ€”it guarantees the integrity of a message during transmission, but it does not provide for nonrepudiation.

HMAC can be *combined with* any standard message digest generation algorithm, such as *SHA-3*, by using a shared secret key. Therefore, only communicating parties who know the key can generate or verify the digital signature. If the recipient decrypts the message digest but cannot successfully compare it to a message digest generated from the plain-text message, that means the message was altered in transit.

Because HMAC relies on a shared secret key, it does not provide any nonrepudiation functionality.
