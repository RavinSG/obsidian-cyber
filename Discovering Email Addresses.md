There are several websites that can be used to find email addresses of targets

- [hunter.io](https://hunter.io)
- [phonebook.cz](https://phonebook.cz/#)
- [Clearbit Connect](https://clearbit.com/resources/tools/connect)

In addition to simple searches, emails of a domain can be used to identify whether there is a pattern in email generation. Such as {f}{last}@domain.com eg: e.musk@tesla.com

Once a candidate email is found, another tool such as [emailhippo](https://tools.emailhippo.com) or [Email-Checker](https://email-checker.net) can be used to verify the validity of it.

If the email has a recovery function such as google, the secondary email can be used to link across email addresses.
