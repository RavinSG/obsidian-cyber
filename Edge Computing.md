The emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) is dramatically changing the way that we provision and use computing. We see the most dramatic examples of the Internet of Things in our everyday lives, from connected and semiautonomous vehicles to smart home devices that improve the way we live and travel.

However, many of the applications of the Internet of Things occur out of sight in manufacturing plants, agricultural fields, and even in outer space. In situations where sensors are in remote locations with poor network connectivity, the traditional cloud model of shipping data back to the [[The Cloud|cloud]] for processing doesn't always work well. 

Instead, it may make more sense to perform some processing close to the sensor to aggregate and minimise the data transferred back to the cloud.

**Edge computing** approaches seek to address this issue by placing some processing power on the remote sensors, allowing them to preprocess data before shipping it back to the cloud. This model takes its name from the fact that the computing is being pushed out to sensors that are located on the “edge” of the network.

**Fog computing** is a related concept that uses IoT gateway devices that are located in close physical proximity to the sensors. The sensors themselves don't necessarily have processing power, but they send data to their local gateway that performs preprocessing before sending the results to the cloud.
