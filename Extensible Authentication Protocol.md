The *Extensible Authentication Protocol* (EAP) is an authentication framework that is commonly used for *wireless networks*. Many different implementations exist that use the EAP framework, including vendor-specific and open methods like **EAP-TLS**, **LEAP**, and **EAP-TTLS**. Each of these protocols implements EAP messages using that protocol's messaging standards.
