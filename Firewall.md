A **firewall** is a network security device that monitors traffic to or from your network. Firewalls can also restrict specific incoming and outgoing network traffic. 

The organization configures the security rules. Firewalls often reside between the secured and controlled internal network and the untrusted network resources outside the organization, such as the internet.
