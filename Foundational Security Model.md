The **CIA triad** is a model that helps inform how organisations consider risk when setting up systems and security policies. It is made up of three elements that cybersecurity analysts and organisations work toward upholding: 

- [[Confidentiality]]
- [[Integrity]]
- [[Availability]] 

Maintaining an acceptable level of risk and ensuring systems and policies are designed with these elements in mind helps establish a successful [[Security Posture]], which refers to an organisationâ€™s ability to manage its defence of critical assets and data and react to change.
