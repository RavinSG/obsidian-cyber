If the right user has been authenticated, the network should ensure the *right resources are made available*. There are three common frameworks that organisations use to handle this step of IAM:

- [[Mandatory Access Control]] (**MAC**)
- [[Discretionary Access Control]] (**DAC**)
- [[Role-Based Access Control]] (**RBAC**)

### Access control technologies

Users often experience **authentication** and **authorisation** as a single, seamless experience. In large part, that’s due to access control technologies that are configured to work together. These tools offer the speed and automation needed by administrators to monitor and modify access rights. They also decrease errors and potential risks.

An organisation's IT department sometimes develops and maintains customized access control technologies on their own. A typical **IAM** or **AAA** system consists of a user directory, a set of tools for managing data in that directory, an authorisation system, and an auditing system. Some organisations create custom systems to tailor them to their security needs. However, building an in-house solution comes at a steep cost of time and other resources.

Instead, many organisations opt to license third-party solutions that offer a suite of tools that enable them to quickly secure their information systems. Keep in mind, security is about more than combining a bunch of tools. It’s always important to configure these technologies so they can help to provide a secure environment.
