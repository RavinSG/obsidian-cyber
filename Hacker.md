A **hacker** is any person who uses computers to gain access to computer systems, networks, or data. They can be beginner or advanced technology professionals who use their skills for a variety of reasons. There are three main categories of hackers:

- Authorised hackers are also called [[Ethical Hackers]]. They follow a code of ethics and adhere to the law to conduct organisational risk evaluations. They are motivated to safeguard people and organisations from malicious threat actors.

- Semi-authorised hackers are considered researchers. They search for vulnerabilities but donâ€™t take advantage of the vulnerabilities they find.

- Unauthorised hackers are also called [[Unethical Hackers]]. They are malicious threat actors who do not follow or respect the law. Their goal is to collect and sell confidential data for financial gain.
