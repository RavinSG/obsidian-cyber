Mobile device hardening is often more challenging than enterprise desktop hardening. Mobile devices are *not as well designed or prepared for central management* and organisational level security in most cases, and there are *fewer security options available to administrators*.

Much like Windows and Linux, iOS and Android hardening benchmarks are available via the **Center for Internet Security** (CIS):

- [iOS benchmark ](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/apple_ios)
- [Android benchmark](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/google_android) 

Hardening techniques include typical practices like *updating and patching the OS*, *enabling remote wipe* functionality, *requiring passcodes*, *setting automatic screen locks*, *wiping the device after excessive passcode failures*, and *turning off connectivity* options like Bluetooth when not in use.
