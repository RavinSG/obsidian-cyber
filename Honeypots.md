Honeypots are an example of an active cyber defence mechanism that *uses deception technology*. Honeypots are systems or resources that are *created as decoys vulnerable to attacks* with the purpose of attracting potential intruders. 

For example, having a fake file labeled Client Credit Card Information - 2022 can be used to capture the activity of malicious actors by tricking them into accessing the file because it appears to be legitimate. Once a malicious actor tries to access this file, security teams are alerted.
