The **NIST incident response lifecycle** is another [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST]] framework with additional sub-steps *dedicated to incident response*. This is a framework for incident response consisting of four phases:

- Preparation
- Detection and Analysis
- Containment, Eradication, and Recovery
- Post-incident activity

One thing to note is that the incident lifecycle isn't a linear process. It's a cycle, which means that steps can overlap as new discoveries are made.

All security [[Incident|incidents]] are [[Event|events]], but not all events are security incidents.

Understanding the composition of incident response teams will help you navigate an organisationâ€™s hierarchy, openly collaborate and communicate with others, and work cohesively to respond to incidents.
