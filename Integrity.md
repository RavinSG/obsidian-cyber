**Integrity** is the idea that the data is verifiably correct, authentic, and reliable. Having protocols in place to verify the authenticity of data is essential. One way to verify data integrity is through [[Cryptography]], which is used to transform data so unauthorised parties cannot read or tamper with it.

Another example of how an organization might implement integrity is by enabling **encryption**, which is the process of converting data from a readable format to an encoded format. [[Encryption]] can be used to prevent access and ensure data, such as messages on an organisation's internal chat platform, cannot be tampered with.
