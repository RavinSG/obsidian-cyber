An intrusion detection system (**IDS**) is an application that *monitors system activity and alerts on possible intrusions*. An IDS provides continuous monitoring of network events to help protect against security threats or attacks. The goal of an IDS is to *detect potential malicious activity* and generate an alert once such activity is detected. An IDS does not stop or prevent the activity. Instead, security professionals will investigate the alert and act to stop it, if necessary. 

For example, an IDS can send out an alert when it identifies a suspicious user login, such as an unknown IP address logging into an application or a device at an unusual time. But, an IDS will not stop or prevent any further actions, like blocking the suspicious user login.
