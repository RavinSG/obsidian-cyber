- **Compliance** is the process of adhering to internal standards and external regulations and enables organisations to avoid fines and security breaches

- **Security Frameworks** are guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risks and therefore threats to data and privacy

- **Security controls** are safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks. They are used with security frameworks to establish a strong security posture

- A **Threat actor**, or malicious attacker, is any person or group who presents a security risk. This risk can relate to computers, applications, networks, and data.

- An **Internal threat** can be a current or *former employee*, an *external vendor*, or a *trusted partner* who poses a security risk. At times, an internal threat is accidental. For example, an employee who accidentally clicks on a malicious email link would be considered an accidental threat. Other times, the internal threat actor ***intentionally*** engages in risky activities, such as unauthorised data access.

- **Network security** is the practice of keeping an organisation's network infrastructure secure from unauthorised access. This includes data, services, systems, and devices that are stored in an organisationâ€™s network.

- **Cloud security** is the process of ensuring that assets stored in the cloud are properly configured, or set up correctly, and access to those assets is limited to authorised users. The cloud is a network made up of a collection of servers or computers that store resources and data in remote physical locations known as data centres that can be accessed via the internet. Cloud security is a growing subfield of cybersecurity that specifically focuses on the protection of data, applications, and infrastructure in the cloud.

- **Programming** is a process that can be used to create a specific set of instructions for a computer to execute tasks. These tasks can include:
	- Automation of repetitive tasks (e.g., searching a list of malicious domains)
	- Reviewing web traffic 
	- Alerting suspicious activity
