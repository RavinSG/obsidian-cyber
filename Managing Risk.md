With a completed risk analysis in hand, organisations can then turn their attention to addressing those risks. Risk management is the *process of systematically addressing the risks facing an organisation*. The [[Analysing Risk#Risk Analysis|risk assessment]] serves two important roles in the risk management process:

- The **risk analysis** provides guidance in **prioritising** **risks** so that the risks with the highest probability and magnitude are addressed first.
  
- **Quantitative risk analyses** help determine whether the potential impact of a risk justifies the costs incurred by adopting a risk management approach.

Risk managers should work their way through the risk assessment and identify an appropriate management strategy for each risk included in the assessment. They have four strategies to choose from: *risk mitigation, risk avoidance, risk transference, and risk acceptance*.
