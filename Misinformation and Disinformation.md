Online influence campaigns have become common and have increasingly been used by governments and other groups as part of *misinformation and disinformation* campaigns. 

**Misinformation** is incorrect information, often resulting from getting facts wrong.

**Disinformation** is incorrect, inaccurate, or outright false information that is intentionally provided to serve an individual or organisation's goals.

**Malinformation** is true, but the sharing of it is meant to cause harm. Harm is derived from either the true statement being shared out of context or at a particularly vulnerable point for the malinformation target.

The CISA recommends a five-step "TRUST" process to counter misinformation and disinformation campaigns.

1. Tell your story
2. Ready your team
3. Understand and assess MDM
4. Strategise response
5. Track outcomes

The CISA's recommendations for preparedness include assessing the information environment, identifying vulnerabilities, fortifying communication channels, engaging in proactive communications, and developing an incident response plan.
