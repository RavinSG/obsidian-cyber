Mobile devices can be a challenge to manage, particularly due to operating system limitations, variability between hardware manufacturers, carrier settings, and operating system versions.

When you add in the wide variety of device deployment models, security practitioners face real challenges in an increasingly mobile deviceâ€“focused environment.
Thus, when administrators and security professionals need to manage mobile devices, they frequently turn to **mobile device management** (MDM) or **unified endpoint management** (UEM) tools. 

*MDM* tools specifically *target devices like Android and iOS phones, tablets*, and other similar systems. 

*UEM* tools *combine mobile devices, desktops and laptops*, and many other types of devices in a single management platform.

Regardless of the type of tool you choose, there are a number of features your organization may use to ensure that your mobile devices and the data they contain are secure. The following list contains some feature available in MDM, UEM, and mobile application management (MAM) tools. 

- *Application management* features are important to allow enterprise control of applications. These features may include deploying specific applications to all devices; limiting which applications can be installed; remotely adding, removing, or changing applications and settings for them; or monitoring application usage.
  
- Content management (sometimes called MCM, or mobile content management) ensures secure access and control of organisational files, including documents and media on mobile devices. A major concern for mobile device deployments is the combination of organizational data and personal data on BYOD and shared-use devices. Content management features lock away business data in a controlled space and then help manage access to that data. In many cases, this requires use of the MDM's application on the mobile device to access and use the data.
