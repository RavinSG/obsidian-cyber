Policy monitoring is an ongoing process that involves *regularly evaluating the implementation and efficacy of an organisation's information security policies*. Through the use of tools like security information and event management (SIEM) systems, as well as by conducting periodic audits and assessments, organisations can *assess how well policies are being adhered to* and **whether they continue to align with current security needs, regulatory requirements, and technological changes**. Effective monitoring also includes gathering feedback from staff members who are integral to policy implementation.

When inconsistencies or areas for improvement are identified, policy revision becomes necessary. This involves updating policies to address any shortcomings and adapting to new challenges or requirements. It is important that revised policies are promptly communicated to all relevant personnel and, if necessary, that training is provided to ensure effective compliance. Regular monitoring and timely revision are crucial for maintaining an adaptive and robust security posture.
