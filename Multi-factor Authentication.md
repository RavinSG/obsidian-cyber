Multi-factor authentication (**MFA**) requires a user to *verify their identity in two or more ways* to access a system or network. In a sense, MFA is similar to using an ATM to withdraw money from your bank account. First, you insert a debit card into the machine as one form of identification. Then, you enter your PIN number as a second form of identification. Combined, both steps, or factors, are used to verify your identity before authorising you to access the account.

### Strengthening authentication

**MFA** builds on the benefits of **SSO**. It works by having users prove that they are who they claim to be. The user must provide two factors (2FA) or three factors (3FA) to authenticate their identification. The MFA process asks users to provide these proofs, such as:

- *Something a user knows*: most commonly a username and password
- *Something a user has*: normally received from a service provider, like a one-time passcode (OTP) sent via SMS
- *Something a user is*: refers to physical characteristics of a user, like their fingerprints or facial scans

Requiring multiple forms of identification is an effective security measure, especially in cloud environments. It can be difficult for businesses in the cloud to ensure that the users remotely accessing their systems are not threat actors. MFA can reduce the risk of authenticating the wrong users by requiring forms of identification that are difficult to imitate or
