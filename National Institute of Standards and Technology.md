The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is a U.S.-based agency that develops multiple voluntary compliance frameworks that organisations worldwide can use to help manage risk. The more aligned an organization is with compliance, the lower the risk.

There are 5 core functions:

- **Identify** - The management of cybersecurity risk and its effect on an organisation's people and assets

- **Protect** - The strategy used to protect an organization through the implementation of policies, procedures, training, and tools that help mitigate cybersecurity threats.

- **Detect** - Identifying potential security incidents and improving monitoring capabilities to increase the speed and efficiency of detections.

- **Respond** - Making sure that the proper procedures are used to contain, neutralise, and analyse security incidents, and implement improvements to the security process.

- **Recovery** - The process of returning affected systems back to normal operation.
