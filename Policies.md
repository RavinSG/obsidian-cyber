Organisations define policies as **formal statements about organisational intent**. In short, they *explain why an organization wishes to operate in a certain way*, and they define things like the purpose or objective of an activity or program. Incident response policies are commonly defined as part of building an IR capability.

Well-written incident response policies will include important components of the IR process. They will *identify the team and the authority that the team operates under*. They will also require the *creation and maintenance of incident handling and response procedures and practices*, and they may define the overall IR process used by the organization. In some cases, they may also have specific communication or compliance requirements that are included in the overall policy based on organisational needs.

>[!Note] 
>It helps to bear in mind that a **policy** is a *high-level statement of management intent* that is used to convey the organisation's expectations and direction for a topic. **Standards** will then point to a policy for their authority, while *providing specific guidance about what should be done*. **Procedures** are then used to *implement standards or to guide how a task is done*.

>Policies tend to be slow to change, whereas standards change more frequently, and procedures and guidelines may be updated frequently to handle organisational needs or technology change, or for other business-related reasons.
