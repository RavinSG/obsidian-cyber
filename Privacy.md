When evaluating privacy risks, be certain to understand the legal implications that may exist based on the jurisdiction(s) where your business operates. You should be familiar with local, regional, national, and global privacy requirements.

Organisations seeking to codify their privacy practices may adopt a privacy notice that outlines their privacy commitments. In some cases, laws or regulations may require that the organisation adopt a privacy notice. In addition, organisations may include privacy statements in their terms of agreement with customers and other stakeholders.

### Data Inventory

Organisations often deal with many different types of sensitive and personal information. The first step in managing this sensitive data is *developing a data inventory of the types of information maintained by the organisation* and the places where that data is stored, processed, and transmitted.

Organisations should include the following data types in their inventory:

- **Personally identifiable information** (PII) includes any information that *uniquely identifies an individual* person, including customers, employees, and third parties.
  
- **Protected health information** (PHI) includes *medical records* maintained by health-care providers and other organisations that are subject to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).
  
- **Financial information** includes any *personal financial records* maintained by the organization. Some of these records may be subject to the provisions of the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act (GLBA) and/or the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS).
  
- **Intellectual property** includes *trade secrets*, which encompass proprietary business information that provides a company with a competitive edge, such as formulas, manufacturing processes, strategies, or any other confidential information.
  
- **Legal information** includes documents, communications, and records that are *related to legal proceedings*, contracts, or corporate governance. This might include attorney-client privileged communications, contracts, legal opinions, court records, and regulatory filings.
  
- **Regulated information** includes any data that is *governed by laws or regulations*. This includes the regulations discussed earlier (HIPAA, GLBA, and PCI DSS), as well as any other rules governing different categories of information.

### Information Classification

Information classification programs **organise data into categories based on the sensitivity of the information and the impact on the organisation** should the information be inadvertently disclosed. For example, the U.S. government uses the following four major classification categories:

- **Top Secret** information requires the highest degree of protection. The unauthorised *disclosure* of Top Secret information could *reasonably be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to national security*.
  
- **Secret** information requires a substantial degree of protection. The unauthorised disclosure of Secret information could *reasonably be expected to cause serious damage to national security*.
  
- **Confidential** information requires some protection. The unauthorised disclosure of Confidential information could reasonably be expected to *cause identifiable damage to national security*.
  
- **Unclassified** information is information that does not meet the standards for classification under the other categories. Information in this category is *still not publicly releasable without authorisation*.

Data classification allows organisations to clearly specify the security controls required to protect information with different levels of sensitivity. For example, the U.S. government requires the use of brightly coloured cover sheets, such as those shown below, to identify classified information in printed form.
