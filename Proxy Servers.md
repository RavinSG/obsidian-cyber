A proxy server is another way to add security to your private network. Proxy servers utilise network address translation ([[Network Address Translation|NAT]]) to serve as a barrier between clients on the network and external threats. 

**Forward proxies** handle queries from internal clients when they access resources external to the network. 

**Reverse proxies** function opposite of forward proxies; they handle requests from external systems to services on the internal network. 

Some proxy servers can also be configured with rules, like a Firewall. For example, you can create filters to block websites identified as containing malware.
