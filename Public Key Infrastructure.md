The major strength of public key encryption is its *ability to facilitate communication between parties previously unknown to each other*. This is made possible by the public key infrastructure (PKI) hierarchy of trust relationships. These trusts permit combining asymmetric cryptography with symmetric cryptography along with hashing and digital certificates, giving us hybrid cryptography.
