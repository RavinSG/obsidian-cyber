Although the analysis of digital artefacts and evidence is important to the forensic process, the **report that is produced at the end is the key product**. Reports need to be useful and contain the relevant information *without delving into every technical nuance* and detail that the analyst may have found during the investigation.
A typical forensic report will include:

- A **summary** of the forensic investigation and findings. 
  
- An **outline** of the forensic process, including tools used and any assumptions that were made about the tools or process.
  
- A series of sections **detailing the findings** for each device or drive. Accuracy is critical when findings are shared, and conclusions must be backed up with evidence and appropriate detail.
  
- **Recommendations** or conclusions in more detail than the summary included.

Forensic practitioners may also provide a report with full detail of the analysis as part of their documentation package.
