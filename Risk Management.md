Some common strategies used to manage [[Risks]] include:

- **Acceptance**: Accepting a risk to avoid disrupting business continuity
- **Avoidance**: Creating a plan to avoid the risk altogether
- **Transference**: Transferring risk to a third party to manage
- **Mitigation**: Lessening the impact of a known risk

Additionally, organisations implement risk management processes based on widely accepted frameworks to help protect digital and physical assets from various threats, risks, and vulnerabilities. 

Examples of frameworks commonly used in the cybersecurity industry include the National Institute of Standards and Technology Risk Management Framework ([[Risk Management Framework|RMF]]) and Health Information Trust Alliance ([[HITRUST]]).
