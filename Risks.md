A **risk** is anything that can impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an asset. A basic formula for determining the level of risk is that risk equals the likelihood of a threat. 

There are different factors that can affect the likelihood of a risk to an organisationâ€™s assets, including:

- **External risk**: Anything outside the organisation that has the potential to harm organisational assets, such as threat actors attempting to gain access to private information

- **Internal risk**: A current or former employee, vendor, or trusted partner who poses a security risk

- **Legacy systems**: Old systems that might not be accounted for or updated, but can still impact assets, such as workstations or old mainframe systems. For example, an organisation might have an old vending machine that takes credit card payments or a workstation that is still connected to the legacy accounting system.

- **Multiparty risk**: Outsourcing work to third-party vendors can give them access to intellectual property, such as trade secrets, software designs, and inventions.

- **Software compliance/licensing**: Software that is not updated or in compliance, or patches that are not installed in a timely manner

One way to interpret risk is to consider the potential effects that negative events can have on a business. Another way to present this idea is with this calculation:
$$Likelihood \times Impact = Risk$$

In general, we calculate risk in this field to help:

- Prevent costly and disruptive events
- Identify improvements that can be made to systems and processes
- Determine which risks can be tolerated
- Prioritise the critical assets that require attention
