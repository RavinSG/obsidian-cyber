Sandboxing is the practise of running an application in a *controlled or isolated environment* to prevent it from interacting negatively with other systems resources and applications.

In a [[Sandbox environments|sandbox environment]] , an application operates with restricted permissions and access to system resources. For instance, a sandboxed application may be limited in its ability to read/write files, interact with the operating system, or communicate with other applications. This *reduces the possibility of a malicious application or a compromised one from causing broader damages* to the system.
