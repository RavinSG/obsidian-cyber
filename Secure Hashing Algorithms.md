To **avoid the risk of hash collisions**, functions that generated longer values were needed. MD5's shortcomings gave way to a new group of functions known as the Secure Hashing Algorithms, or SHAs.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology ([[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST]]) approves each of these algorithms. Numbers besides each SHA function indicate the size of its hash value in bits. Except for SHA-1, which produces a 160-bit digest, these algorithms are considered to be collision-resistant. However, that doesnâ€™t make them invulnerable to other exploits.

There are 5 SHA Algorithms
- SHA-1
- SHA-224
- SHA-256
- SHA-384
- SHA-512
