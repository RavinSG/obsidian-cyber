This domain focuses on managing data security. Ensuring effective tools, systems, and processes are in place helps protect an organization’s assets and data. Security architects and engineers create these processes.

One important aspect of this domain is the concept of *shared responsibility*. Shared responsibility means all individuals involved take an active role in lowering risk during the design of a security system. Additional design principles related to this domain include:

- Threat modelling
- Least privilege
- Defence in depth
- Fail securely
- Separation of duties
- Keep it simple
- Zero trust
- Trust but verify

An example of managing data is the use of a security information and event management ([[Security Information and Event Management|SIEM]]) tool to monitor for flags related to unusual login or user activity that could indicate a threat actor is attempting to access private data.
