A **security audit** is a review of an organization's security controls, policies, and procedures against a set of expectations. 

Audits are *independent reviews* that evaluate whether an organization is meeting internal and external criteria. Internal criteria include outlined policies, procedures, and best practices. External criteria include regulatory compliance, laws, and federal regulations. 

Additionally, a security audit can be used to assess an organisation's established [[Security Controls]]. 

Audits help ensure that security checks are made (i.e., daily monitoring of security information and event management dashboards), to identify [[Threats]], [[Risks]], and [[Vulnerabilities]]. 

This helps maintain an organisationâ€™s security posture. And, if there are security issues, a remediation process must be in place.
