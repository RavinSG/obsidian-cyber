Security training and awareness programs help ensure that *employees and other stakeholders are aware of their information security responsibilities and that those responsibilities remain top-of-mind*. Information security managers are responsible for establishing, promoting, and maintaining an information security training and awareness program to foster an effective security culture in their organisations.

### User Training

Users within an organisation should receive regular security training to ensure that they understand the risks associated with your computing environment and their role in minimising those risks. Strong training programs take advantage of a diversity of training techniques, including the use of computer-based training (CBT).

#### Role-Based Training

Not every user requires the same level of training. Organisations should use role-based training to make sure that *individuals receive the appropriate level of training based on their job responsibilities*. For example, a systems administrator should receive detailed and highly technical training, whereas a customer service representative requires less technical training with a greater focus on social engineering and pretexting attacks that they may encounter in their work.

#### User Guidance and Training

Phishing attacks often target users at all levels of the organisation, and every security awareness program should include specific anti-phishing campaigns designed to help users recognise suspicious messages and respond to phishing attempts appropriately. These campaigns often involve the use of phishing simulations, which send users fake phishing messages to test their skills. Users who click on the simulated phishing message are sent to a training program designed to help them better recognise fraudulent messages.

**Anomalous behaviour** recognition is also an important component of security awareness training. Employees should be able to *recognise when risky, unexpected, and/or unintentional behaviour takes place*. The insider threat posed by employees with legitimate access permissions is significant, and other employees may be the first to notice the signs of anomalous behaviour that could be a security concern.

Other topics that should be included in end-user security training programs include:

- *Security Policies and Handbooks*: Provide users with information about where they can find critical security documents.
  
- *Situational Awareness*: Update users on the security threats facing the organisation and how they can recognise suspicious activity.
  
- *Insider Threats*: Remind users that employees, contractors, and other insiders may pose a security risk and that they should be alert for anomalous behaviour.
  
- *Password Management*: Educate users about your organisation's password standards and the importance of not reusing passwords across multiple sites.
  
- *Removable Media and Cables*: Inform users of the risks associated with the use of USB drives, external hard drives, and other removable media, as well as unfamiliar cables. Educate them on the policies for using these devices and the importance of scanning for malware before accessing files.
  
- *Social Engineering*: Train users to recognise and respond to social engineering attacks. Teach them to be skeptical of unsolicited communications, especially those that create a sense of urgency or require sensitive information.
  
- *Operational Security*: Educate users on the importance of protecting sensitive information during day-to-day operations. This includes understanding the importance of access controls, not discussing sensitive information in public or unsecured areas, and being vigilant about who has access to sensitive data.
  
- *Hybrid/Remote Work Environments*: Instruct users on best practices for securing data and maintaining privacy when working remotely or in hybrid environments. This includes the use of VPNs, secure Wi-Fi networks, ensuring physical security of devices, and understanding the specific policies and procedures that are in place for remote work.

#### Training Frequency

You'll need to balance the time required to conduct training with the benefit from reminding users of their responsibilities. One approach used by many organisations is to *conduct initial training whenever an employee joins* the organisation or assumes new job responsibilities and then *use annual refresher trainings* to cover the same material and update users on new threats and controls.

#### Development and Execution

The development of security training programs begins with a *thorough assessment of the organisation's security landscape and identifying potential risks and threats*. Based on this assessment, the team can develop tailored content that addresses the unique challenges of the organisation.

It's helpful to incorporate real-world examples and interactive elements to keep participants engaged. Aligning the training with the organisation's policies and procedures ensures consistency and relevance.

The execution phase should *include a variety of training methods*, such as **workshops**, **e-learning modules**, and **simulations**, catering to different learning preferences. An essential aspect of execution is to make training accessible and regular for all employees.

#### Reporting and Monitoring

Administrators should *track participation in training programs* and assess user knowledge through quizzes and other means. You should also collect feedback from employees to understand their perspectives and make necessary adjustments to the program.

It's helpful to provide decision-makers with regular reports that *provide both detailed data for technical stakeholders and high-level trends for management*. Over time, an analysis of trends in knowledge levels and security incidents is essential for understanding the long-term impact of the training program.

The team responsible for providing security training should review materials on a regular basis to ensure that the content remains relevant. Changes in the security landscape and the organisation's business may require updating the material to remain fresh and relevant.

### Ongoing Awareness Efforts

In addition to formal training programs, an information security program should include security awareness efforts. These are less formal efforts that are *designed to remind employees about the security lessons they've already learned*. Unlike security training, awareness efforts don't require a commitment of time to sit down and learn new material. Instead, they use **posters**, **videos**, **email messages**, and similar techniques to keep security top-of-mind for those who've already learned the core lessons
