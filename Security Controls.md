Security controls are *safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks*. So they are used alongside [[Security Frameworks|frameworks]] to ensure that security goals and processes are implemented correctly and that organisations meet regulatory compliance requirements.

For example, a control that can be used alongside frameworks to ensure a hospital remains compliant with HIPAA is requiring that patients use multi-factor authentication (MFA) to access their medical records. Using a measure like MFA to validate someoneâ€™s identity is one way to help mitigate potential risks and threats to private data.

Examples of physical controls:
- Gates, fences, and locks 
- Security guards
- Closed-circuit television (CCTV), surveillance cameras, and motion detectors
- Access cards or badges to enter office spaces

Examples of technical controls:
- Firewalls
- MFA
- Antivirus software

Examples of administrative controls:
- Separation of duties
- Authorization
- Asset classification
