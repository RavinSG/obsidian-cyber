Security controls are *safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks*. So they are used alongside [[Security Frameworks|frameworks]] to ensure that security goals and processes are implemented correctly and that organisations meet regulatory compliance requirements.

For example, a control that can be used alongside frameworks to ensure a hospital remains compliant with HIPAA is requiring that patients use multi-factor authentication (MFA) to access their medical records. Using a measure like MFA to validate someoneâ€™s identity is one way to help mitigate potential risks and threats to private data.

There are three main categories of controls:

- [[Administrative controls|Administrative/Managerial controls|]]
- [[Technical controls]]
- [[Physical controls]]

### Control types

Control types include, but are not limited to:

- Preventative - prevent an incident from occurring in the first place
- Corrective - restore an asset after an incident
- Detective - determine whether an incident has occurred or is in progress
- Deterrent - discourage attacks

These controls work together to provide defence in depth and protect assets.
