### Information Security Governance

Information security governance is a natural extension of corporate governance. The board delegates operational authority to the CEO, who then delegates specific areas of authority to subordinate executives. For example, the CEO might delegate financial authority to the chief financial officer (**CFO**) and operational authority to the chief operations officer (**COO**). Similarly, the CEO delegates information security responsibility to the chief information security officer (**CISO**) or other responsible executive.

This hierarchical approach to governance helps ensure that information security governance efforts are integrated into corporate governance efforts, ensuring that the organization's information security program supports broader organizational goals and objectives. The CISO and CEO must work together to ensure the proper alignment of the information security program with corporate governance.

The CISO then works with other peers on the senior management team to design and implement an information security governance framework that guides the activity of the information security function and ensures alignment with the organisation's information security strategy. This governance framework may take many different forms. It normally involves the establishment of a management structure for the cybersecurity team that aligns with management approaches used elsewhere in the organization.

The information security governance framework should also include the mechanisms that the security team will use to enforce security requirements across the organization. This is particularly important because the CISO does not exercise operational control over the entire organization but needs management leverage to ensure the organization meets its cybersecurity requirements. This is normally done through the creation of policies that apply to the entire organisation.
