A **SIEM tool** is an application that collects and analyses [[Security Logs|log data]] to monitor critical activities in an organization. 

**A log** is a record of events that occur within an organisation’s systems. Depending on the amount of data you’re working with, it could take hours or days to filter through log data on your own. 

SIEM tools reduce the amount of data an analyst must review by providing alerts for specific types of [[Threats|threats]], [[Risks|risks]], and [[Vulnerabilities|vulnerabilities]].

SIEM tools provide a series of *dashboards* that visually organise data into categories, allowing users to select the data they wish to analyse. Different SIEM tools have different dashboard types that display the information you have access to.

SIEM tools also come with different hosting options, including *on-premise and cloud*. Organisations may choose one hosting option over another based on a security team member’s expertise. For example, because a cloud-hosted version tends to be easier to set up, use, and maintain than an on-premise version, a less experienced security team may choose this option for their organization.

### The future of SIEM tools

As cybersecurity continues to evolve, the need for cloud functionality has increased. SIEM tools have and continue to evolve to function in *cloud-hosted* and *cloud-native* environments. 

**Cloud-hosted** SIEM tools are operated by vendors who are responsible for maintaining and managing the infrastructure required to use the tools. Cloud-hosted tools are simply accessed through the internet and are an ideal solution for organisations that don’t want to invest in creating and maintaining their own infrastructure.

**Cloud-native** SIEM tools are also fully maintained and managed by vendors and accessed through the internet. However, cloud-native tools are designed to take full advantage of cloud computing capabilities, such as availability, flexibility, and scalability.
