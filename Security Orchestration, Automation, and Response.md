Security orchestration, automation, and response (**SOAR**) is a collection of applications, tools, and workflows that uses automation to respond to security events. 

Essentially, this means that handling common security-related incidents with the use of [[Security Information and Event Management|SIEM]] tools is expected to become a more streamlined process requiring less manual intervention. This frees up security analysts to handle more complex and uncommon incidents that, consequently, canâ€™t be automated with a SOAR.
