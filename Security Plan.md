Security plans consist of three basic elements: **policies**, **standards**, and **procedures**

### Policy

**A policy** in security is a *set of rules that reduce risk and protects information*. Policies are the foundation of every security plan. They give everyone in and out of an organization guidance by addressing questions like, what are we protecting and why? Policies focus on the strategic side of things by identifying the scope, objectives, and limitations of a security plan. 

For instance, newly hired employees at many companies are required to sign off on acceptable use policy, or AUP. These provisions outline secure ways that an employee may access corporate systems.
### Standards

**Standards** are references that inform *how to set policies*. A good way to think of standards is that they create a point of reference. 

For example, many companies use the password management standard identified in NIST Special Publication 800-63B to improve their security policies by specifying that employees' passwords must be at least eight characters long.
### Procedures

 **Procedures** are step-by-step *instructions to perform a specific security task*. Organisations usually keep multiple procedure documents that are used throughout the company, like how employees can choose secure passwords, or how they can securely reset a password if it's been locked. Sharing clear and actionable procedures with everyone creates accountability, consistency, and efficiency across an organization.
