Smishing relies on text messages as a part of the phishing scam. Whereas other scams often rely on targets disclosing information via social engineering, smishing scams frequently attempt to get users to click on a link in a text message.

The link may take them to a fake site to capture credentials, may attempt to infect the recipient's phone with malware, may request MFA information like SMS code, or could target some other information or action.
