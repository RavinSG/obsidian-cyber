**Social engineering** is a manipulation technique that [[Phishing|exploits human error]] to gain private information, access, or valuables. Human error is usually a result of trusting someone without question. It’s the mission of a threat actor, acting as a social engineer, to create an environment of false trust and lies to exploit as many people as possible. 

Some of the most common types of social engineering attacks today include:

- **Social media phishing**: A threat actor collects detailed information about their target from social media sites. Then, they initiate an attack.

- **Watering hole attack**: A threat actor attacks a website frequently visited by a specific group of users.

- **USB baiting**: A threat actor strategically leaves a malware USB stick for an employee to find and install, to unknowingly infect a network. 

- **Physical social engineering**: A threat actor impersonates an employee, customer, or vendor to obtain unauthorised access to a physical location.

## Social engineering principles 

Social engineering is incredibly effective. This is because people are generally trusting and conditioned to respect authority. The number of social engineering attacks is increasing with every new social media application that allows public access to people's data. Although sharing personal data—such as your location or photos—can be convenient, it’s also a risk.

Reasons why social engineering attacks are effective include:

- **Authority**: Threat actors impersonate individuals with power. This is because people, in general, have been conditioned to respect and follow authority figures.

- **Intimidation**: Threat actors use bullying tactics. This includes persuading and intimidating victims into doing what they’re told.

- **Consensus/Social proof**: Because people sometimes do things that they believe many others are doing, threat actors use others’ trust to pretend they are legitimate. For example, a threat actor might try to gain access to private data by telling an employee that other people at the company have given them access to that data in the past.

- **Scarcity**: A tactic used to imply that goods or services are in limited supply. 

- **Familiarity**: Threat actors establish a fake emotional connection with users that can be exploited.  

- **Trust**: Threat actors establish an emotional relationship with users that can be exploited over time. They use this relationship to develop trust and gain personal information.

- **Urgency**: A threat actor persuades others to respond quickly and without questioning.
