Spyware is malware that is designed to *obtain information about an individual, organization, or system*. Many spyware packages **track users' browsing habits, installed software, or similar information** and report it back to central servers. 

Some spyware is relatively innocuous, but malicious spyware exists that targets sensitive data, allows remote access to web cameras, or otherwise provides illicit or undesirable access to the systems it is installed on.
