A supply-chain attack targets systems, applications, hardware, and/or software to locate a vulnerability where malware can be deployed. 

Because every item sold undergoes a process that involves third parties, this means that the security breach can occur at any point in the supply chain. 

These attacks are costly because they can affect multiple organisations and the individuals who work for them. 

Supply-chain attacks can fall under several domains, including but not limited to the [[Security and Risk Management]], [[Security Architecture and Engineering]], and [[Security Operations]] domains.
