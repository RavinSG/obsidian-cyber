### In-Band SQL Injection
In-Band SQL Injection is the easiest type to detect and exploit; In-Band just refers to the same method of communication being used to exploit the vulnerability and also receive the results, for example, discovering an SQL Injection vulnerability on a website page and then *being able to extract data from the database to the same page*.

### Error-Based SQL Injection
This type of SQL Injection is the most useful for easily obtaining information about the database structure, as *error messages from the database are printed directly to the browser screen*. This can often be used to enumerate a whole database.
