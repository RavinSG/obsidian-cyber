Many risks facing an organization come from third-party organisations with whom the organization does business. These risks may be the result of a vendor relationship that arises somewhere along the organisation's supply chain, or they may be the result of other business partnerships.

### Vendor Selection

*Due diligence* involves thoroughly vetting potential vendors to ensure that they meet the organisation's standards and requirements. This process should include an evaluation of the vendor's financial stability, business reputation, quality of products or services, and compliance with relevant regulations. You should also examine the vendor's security practices and data handling procedures, especially when they will be dealing with sensitive or proprietary information.

Another essential aspect of vendor selection is identifying and *mitigating conflicts of interest*. A conflict of interest arises when a vendor has a competing interest that could influence their behaviour in a way that is not aligned with the best interests of the organization.  

### Vendor Assessment

After the initial selection process, organisations should continuously assess the chosen vendors to ensure they *maintain the expected quality, security, and performance levels*. One method to evaluate a vendor's security is **through penetration testing**, where authorised simulated attacks are carried out to identify vulnerabilities in the vendor's systems.

Vendor agreements *should include a right-to-audit* clause that allows the customer to conduct or commission audits on the vendor's operations and practices to ensure compliance with terms and conditions, as well as regulatory requirements.

Furthermore, organisations should **request evidence of internal audits** conducted by the vendor. These audits can provide insights into the vendor's internal controls, compliance, and risk management practices.

*Independent assessments* are also an essential tool. They may involve bringing in third-party experts to objectively evaluate the vendor's practices and systems. These assessments can include certification verifications, such as **ISO 27001 or SOC reports**.

*Supply chain analysis* is vital in understanding the risks associated with the vendor's supply chain. This includes assessing the vendor's suppliers and understanding the interdependencies and risks that could impact the vendor's ability to deliver products or services.

Organisations can *employ questionnaires* to collect information regarding the vendor's practices and performance regularly. These questionnaires can be tailored to focus on specific areas of concern, such as security policies, data handling procedures, and business continuity planning.

### Vendor Agreements

Organisations may deploy some standard agreements and practices to manage third-party vendor risks. Commonly used agreements include the following:

- **Master service agreements** (MSAs) provide an umbrella contract for the work that a vendor does with an organization over an extended period of time. The MSA typically includes detailed security and privacy requirements. Each time the organization enters into a new project with the vendor, they may then create a work order (WO) or a statement of work (SOW) that contains project-specific details and references the MSA.
  
- **Service level agreements** (SLAs) are written contracts that specify the conditions of service that will be provided by the vendor and the remedies available to the customer if the vendor fails to meet the SLA. SLAs commonly cover issues such as system availability, data durability, and response time.
