Organisations can improve their detection capabilities by staying updated on the evolving threat landscape and understanding the relationship between their environment and malicious actors. One way to understand threats is by using **threat intelligence**, which is evidence-based threat information that provides context about existing or emerging threats. 

Threat intelligence can come from private or public sources like:

- *Industry reports*: These often include details about attacker's **tactics, techniques, and procedures** (TTP).

- *Government advisories*: Similar to industry reports, government advisories include details about attackers' TTP. 

- *Threat data feeds*: Threat data feeds provide a stream of threat-related data that can be used to help protect against sophisticated attackers like advanced persistent threats ([[Advanced Persistent Threats|APTs]]). The data is usually a list of indicators like *IP addresses*, *domains, and file hashes*.

It can be difficult for organisations to efficiently manage large volumes of threat intelligence. Organisations can leverage a *threat intelligence platform* (**TIP**) which is an application that collects, centralises, and analyses threat intelligence from different sources. TIPs provide a centralised platform for organisations to identify and prioritise relevant threats and improve their security posture.
