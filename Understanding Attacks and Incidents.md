Incident responders frequently need ways to describe attacks and incidents using common language and terminology. Attack frameworks are used to understand adversaries, document techniques, and categorise tactics.

## MITRE ATT&CK

[[MITRE]] provides the **ATT&CK**, or Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge knowledge-base of adversary tactics and techniques. The ATT&CK matrices includes detailed descriptions, definitions, and examples for the complete threat life cycle from reconnaissance through execution, persistence, privilege escalation, and impact. At each level, *it lists techniques and components, allowing threat assessment modelling* to leverage common descriptions and knowledge.

ATT&CK matrices include pre-attack, enterprise matrices focusing on Windows, macOS, Linux, and cloud computing, as well as iOS and Android mobile platforms. It also includes details of data sources, threat actor groups, software, and a host of other useful details. All of this adds up to make ATT&CK the most comprehensive freely available database of adversary techniques, tactics, and related information that the authors of this book are aware of.
