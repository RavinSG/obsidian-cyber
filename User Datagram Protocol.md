**User Datagram Protocol** is a *connectionless protocol* that does not establish a connection between devices before a transmission. 

This makes it *less reliable* than TCP. But it also means that it works well for transmissions that need to get to their destination quickly. For example, one use of UDP is for internet gaming transmissions. 

In the TCP/IP model, UDP occurs at the [[Transport Layer]].
