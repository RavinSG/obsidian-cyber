There are resources on the internet that keep track of vulnerabilities for all sorts of software, operating systems and more! 

## National Vulnerability Database (**NVD**)

The National Vulnerability Database is a website that lists all *publicly categorised vulnerabilities*. In cybersecurity, vulnerabilities are classified under “Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures” ([[Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures|CVE]]).

NVD allows you to see all the CVEs that have been confirmed, using filters by category and month of submission.

While this website helps keep track of new vulnerabilities, it is not great when searching for vulnerabilities for a specific application or scenario.

## Exploit-DB

Exploit-DB is a resource that hackers will find much more helpful during an assessment. Exploit-DB retains *exploits for software and applications* stored under the name, author and version of the software or application.

We can use Exploit-DB to look for snippets of code (known as Proof of Concepts) that are used to exploit a specific vulnerability.
