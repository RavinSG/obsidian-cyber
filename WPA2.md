The second version of Wi-Fi Protected Access—known as **WPA2**—was released in 2004. WPA2 improves upon WPA by using the **Advanced Encryption Standard** ([[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES]]).

WPA2 also improves upon WPA’s use of TKIP. WPA2 uses the *Counter Mode Cipher Block Chain Message Authentication Code Protocol* (CCMP), which provides encapsulation and ensures message authentication and integrity. 

Because of the strength of WPA2, it is considered the security standard for all Wi-Fi transmissions today. WPA2, like its predecessor, is vulnerable to KRACK attacks. This led to the development of [[WPA3]] in 2018. 

## Personal

WPA2 personal mode is best suited for home networks for a variety of reasons. It is easy to implement, initial setup takes less time for personal than enterprise version. The *global passphrase* for WPA2 personal version *needs to be applied to each individual computer* and access point in a network. This makes it ideal for home networks, but unmanageable for organisations. 

## Enterprise

WPA2 enterprise mode works best for business applications. It provides the necessary security for wireless networks in business settings. The initial setup is more complicated than WPA2 personal mode, but enterprise mode *offers individualised and centralised control over the Wi-Fi access* to a business network. This means that **network administrators can grant or remove user access to a network at any time**. Users never have access to encryption keys, this prevents potential attackers from recovering network keys on individual computers.
