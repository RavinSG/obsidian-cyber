The term Wi-Fi covers a *range of wireless protocols* that are used to provide wireless networking. Wi-Fi primarily relies on the **2.4 GHz and 5 GHz radio bands** and uses multiple channels within those bands to allow multiple networks to coexist. Wi-Fi signals can reach to reasonably long ranges, although the frequencies Wi-Fi operates on are blocked or impeded by common obstacles like walls and trees. Despite those impediments, one of the most important security concerns with Wi-Fi networks is that *they travel beyond the spaces that organisations own or control*.

The earlier generations of Wi-Fi, including 802.11b to 802.11g, were not branded as Wi-Fi 1, Wi-Fi 2, and so on. More modern versions of Wi-Fi have been as the standard continues to evolve. We may hear more modern versions of Wi-Fi referred to by the standard or the generation name, depending on the context we're working in.

The table below shows the Wi-Fi standards and their maximum theoretical speed, and frequencies.

| Wi-Fi Standard | Generation Name      | Maximum Speed | Frequencies           |
| -------------- | -------------------- | ------------- | --------------------- |
| 802.11b        |                      | 11 Mbit/s     | 2.4 GHz               |
| 802.11a        |                      | 54 Mbit/s     | 5 GHz                 |
| 802.11g        |                      | 54 Mbit/s     | 2.4 GHz               |
| 802.11n        | Wi-Fi 4              | 600 Mbit/s    | 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz     |
| 802.11ac       | Wi-Fi 5              | 6.9 Gbit/s    | 5 GHz                 |
| 802.11ax       | Wi-Fi 6 and Wi-Fi 6E | 9.6 Gbit/s    | 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, 6 GHz |
| 802.11be       | Wi-Fi 7              | 40+ Gbit/s    | 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, 6 GHz |
