Many people today refer to wireless internet as **Wi-Fi**. Wi-Fi refers to a set of standards that define communication for wireless LANs. Wi-Fi is a marketing term commissioned by the *Wireless Ethernet Compatibility Alliance* (WECA). WECA has since renamed their organization Wi-Fi Alliance. 

Wi-Fi standards and protocols are based on the *802.11 family* of internet communication standards determined by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). So, you might also see *Wi-Fi referred to as IEEE 802.11*.

Wi-Fi communications are secured by [[Wireless Networking Protocols]]. Wireless security protocols have evolved over the years, helping to identify and resolve vulnerabilities with more advanced wireless technologies.
