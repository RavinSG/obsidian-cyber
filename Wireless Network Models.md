Wireless technologies operate in one of four major connection models: **point-to-point**, **point-to-multipoint**, **mesh**, or **broadcast**. The figure below shows both a point-to-point network between two systems or devices, and a point-to-multipoint network design that connects to multiple devices from a single location.

Each of these design models is simple to understand. A point-to-point network connects two nodes, and transmissions between them can only be received by the endpoints. Point-to-multipoint networks like Wi-Fi have many nodes receiving the information sent by a node. Broadcast designs send out information on many nodes and typically do not care about receiving a response. GPS and radio are both examples of broadcast models.
