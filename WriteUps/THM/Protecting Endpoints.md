As a security professional, you'll be asked to recommend, implement, manage, or assess security solutions intended to protect desktops, mobile devices, servers, and a variety of other systems found in organisations. 

These devices are often called **endpoints**, meaning they're an *end point of a network*, whether that is a wired or wireless network.
